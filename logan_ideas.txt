Classification should be

classifySymbol :: Classification -> (Symbol) -> [DataSets] -> (SymbolName)

classifySymbols :: Classification -> [(Symbol)] -> [DataSets] -> [(SymbolNames)]

(Symbol) might need to be different than the symbol currently used in Orca.Reader.Types, since the classification might not need the location data? 

DataSets are (DataSetType, [(Image, SymbolName)]) or something like that

DataSetType = ImageData | Eigenfaces
